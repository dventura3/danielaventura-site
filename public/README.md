Front-End Site
==============

In order to implement the front-end of my personal site, I have used AngularJS & Bootstrap 3.2.0.

The bower.json file does not contain the reference to bootstrap because I have modified it in Less files.
Therefore a custom version of Bootstrap is directly downloadable with this mine repository.
